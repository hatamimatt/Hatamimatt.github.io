# My Journey

I am currently a **PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>**, working in the **Climate Resilience Lab** under <a href="https://nassernajibi.github.io/lab/" target="_blank">Dr. Nasser Najibi’s research group</a> in the Department of Agricultural & Biological Engineering.  

<br>

My research focuses on **Hydroclimate Extremes & Risk**, specifically:  

<br>

- Characterizing and modeling **hydroclimatic extremes** (floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, heatwaves)  
- Developing **stochastic decision frameworks** to improve infrastructure and ecosystem resilience under deep uncertainty  
- Integrating **process-based and ensemble approaches** to assess climate vulnerability across water, energy, transportation, agriculture, and public health sectors

## Previous Research & Education

<br>

### University of South Carolina (USA)

I began my PhD at the <a href="https://www.sc.edu/" target="_blank">University of South Carolina</a> in Civil Engineering within the iWERS lab, where I conducted research under **Dr. Erfan Goharian**.  

<br>

Concurrently, I pursued graduate-level coursework in Computer Science before transferring to UF after my advisor resigned.  

<br>

### University of Groningen (Netherlands)

I spent **4 months** at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/" target="_blank">University of Groningen</a> in the SCIO cluster (Sustainable Cooperation, Institutions & Organizations).  

<br>

There, I developed an **agent-based model** simulating human behavior during cascading disasters to support resilience planning.  

<br>

### Politecnico di Milano (Italy)

I earned my **MSc in Civil Engineering for Risk Mitigation (CERM)** at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank">Politecnico di Milano</a>.  

<br>

My thesis—*“Application of Deep Learning and Remote Sensing in Disaster Management”*—leveraged satellite data and AI to assess hazards.  

<br>

### International University of Imam Khomeini (Iran)

I completed my **BSc in Civil Engineering** at <a href="https://www.ikiu.ac.ir/" target="_blank">IKIU</a>.  

<br>

My undergraduate focus on river hydrology and hydraulics sparked my enduring interest in flood risk and disaster resilience.
